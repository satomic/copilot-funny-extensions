# Why Built This
From a management perspective
- The purpose of this extension is for **GitHub Copilot administrators to promote Copilot Chat and Extensions within their company**.
- When you install this GitHub App in your GitHub Organization, users in the Organization can play this game and have chances to win prizes!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ (each GitHub user can only play for one time).
- So as a GitHub Copilot administrator, you can use this extension to **encourage users to use Copilot Chat and Extensions**, not only code completion.

From technically perspective
- This program is a web-based roulette application built with Flask. It presents users with an interactive spinning wheel and displays real-time results using Server-Sent Events (SSE). 
- When a user plays, the app logs winners in a history file and shows them in the interface. 
- Each prize is assigned a weight, and the system uses those probabilities for every spin. 


# Quick Try
- I've created a public GitHub App [**Roulette Play**](https://github.com/apps/roulette-play) based on this project that you can install in your account and try it out. You can refer to [Website Updater Quick Try](https://github.com/satomic/copilot-funny-extensions/tree/main/skillset-website-updater#quick-try) to set it up, it is almost exactly the same.
- Visit online [**Roulette Play**](https://demo.softrin.com/roulette).
- In GitHub Copilot Chat, `@roulette-play` say something like `I want to play the developer's roulette game` to start the game.

# Create Your Own Extension

## Deploy Backend Service

### Source Code Mode

1. Download source code
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/satomic/copilot-funny-extensions.git
   cd skillset-roulette
   ```
1. Set your own configurations in `prizes.json`
   - key: the name of the prize
   - `color`: the color of the prize
   - `index`: The winning index of a specific prize, for example, with the following configuration, the probability of winning Banana is `2/(1+2+3+4+10)*100% = 10%`
   ```json
   {
        "Apple": { "color": "#FFA500", "index": 1 },
        "Banana": { "color": "#FF4500", "index": 2 },
        "Cherry": { "color": "#FFD700", "index": 3 },
        "Durian": { "color": "#7FFF00", "index": 4 },
        "thanks": { "color": "#1E90FF", "index": 10 }
   }
   ```
   Based on this configuration, the resulting Roulette is

1. Install requirements
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
1. Set environment variables (Optional)
   - `VERIFY_REQUEST_FROM_GITHUB`: for debug use, when set to `True`, the request from GitHub will be verified, otherwise, it will not be verified, then you can use `curl` to send requests to the backend service directly.
        ```bash
        curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8082/play -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "player1"}'
        ```
   - `DEBUG_USERS`: for debug use, the user setted here can play the game for multiple times

   Set environment variables
   - Windows
        ```PowerShell
        $Env:VERIFY_REQUEST_FROM_GITHUB="True" # default is True
        $Env:DEBUG_USERS="your_github_id" # default is satomic
        ```
   - Linux/Mac
        ```bash
        export VERIFY_REQUEST_FROM_GITHUB="True" # default is True
        export DEBUG_USERS="your_github_id" # default is satomic
        ```
1. Run
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
1. Publish this service, it should be [publicly accessible via HTTPS](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/building-a-copilot-skillset-for-your-copilot-extension/building-copilot-skillsets#prerequisites). The easiest way is using **VSCode Ports Forwarding** (you can use anyway you like). Remember set the **Visibility** to **Public**.

### Docker Mode

1. Download source code in to a Linux with docker installed.
1. Set your own configurations in `prizes.json`.
1. Build docker
   ```bash
   bash docker_build.sh
   ```
1. Run docker (I published my docker image `satomic/roulette` already, you can just use it directly).
   ```bash
   docker run -itd \
    --net=host \
    --restart=always \
    --name roulette \
    -v /srv/roulette-logs:/app/logs \
    -e VERIFY_REQUEST_FROM_GITHUB=True \
    -e DEBUG_USERS=your_github_id \
   satomic/roulette # change this to your own image
   ```
1. You need to fix the HTTPS problem by yourself ðŸ™‚. Because backend service should be [publicly accessible via HTTPS](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/building-copilot-extensions/building-a-copilot-skillset-for-your-copilot-extension/building-copilot-skillsets#prerequisites).

## Create GitHub App & Following Steps
You can refer to [Create GitHub App](https://github.com/satomic/copilot-funny-extensions/tree/main/skillset-website-updater#Create-GitHub-App) to set it up, it is almost exactly the same. The only differences are the following:

### Copilot
1. **Skill definitions**
   1. **message**
      - Name: `message`
      - Inference description: `the message that user send to the extension, to be used for play a game for developers, and tell the participants the results of the game.`
      - URL: you need to use your own URL, if you are using VSCode Ports Forwarding, it should be like `https://2npk0g6z-8081.asse.devtunnels.ms/play`
      - Parameters:
      ```json
      {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
              "message ": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "the original message that user send to the extension, to be used for play a game for developers"
              }
          }
      }
      ```

### Try Your Own Extension
1. Check your own website. If you use VSCode Ports Forwarding, it should be like `https://2npk0g6z-8082.asse.devtunnels.ms`.
2. In GitHub Copilot Chat, `@YOUR_EXTENSION_NAME` say something like `I want to play the developer's roulette game` to start the game.
